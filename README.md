# Reshade Preset Switcher
Reshade Preset Switcher for Nexus.
This addon uses **macros** (virtual key-presses) to switch reshade presets. However, it does not activate any in-game functions so should be TOS friendly.

## Features
- Integrates with Reshade.ini to dynamically switch presets on map change.
- Rule system to define which preset to use under given conditions.

## Installation
1. Install the [Nexus](https://github.com/RaidcoreGG/Nexus) addon manager ([website](https://raidcore.gg/Nexus)).
2. Download [`reshade_preset_switcher.dll`](../../releases/latest) and place it in your `addons` folder (e.g. `C:\Program Files\Guild Wars 2\addons`).
3. Open the Nexus addon window, click on the refresh button if necessary and load Reshade Preset Switcher.
